Overview:
Climb and Slide is a variation of the traditional game, Snakes and Ladders  
The game is two-player and the goal is to reach the last square in the top left corner of the board while dodging slippery slides and utilizing the various ropes to gain speed. We utilized stars to cause random questions to pop-up while the players are involved in the game to increase critical thinking and involve interesting trivia 

History: 
Moksha Patam was the original name of the game and it originated from Ancient India 
It was later brought to the UK in the 1890s
The game is a simple race based on sheer luck, and it’s usually played by younger children and families alike
The historic version had its roots in morality lessons, as a player's progression up the board represented a life journey complicated by virtues (ladders) and vices (snakes). 

What We Learned:
We developed a better understanding of how turtle graphics work and how to implement randomization in the functions that we used
We had to learn how to animate the pieces/characters 
More about our culture as we are both Indian

Things We Enjoyed:
The relationship we had with this game and using that to fuel our motivation
Creating random questions to incorporate into the game 
Being able to customize the game in a more non-traditional way
Overcoming problems we got while coding as a whole

Challenges:
When we were planning this game, we expected to do a lot more than what we were able to accomplish. It took a lot of time to figure out how to differentiate between random players and the choice between playing a multiplayer game and playing against the computer.
It also took time to figure out how the dice rolls would be different depending 
Another challenge that we weren’t able to figure out in time was how to have the character pawns turn around on the board and how to have the pawns slide down the slide and climb up the rope.
We didn’t expect that overcoming these challenges would take so long, so the code that we uploaded is a prototype of how the game should work.
