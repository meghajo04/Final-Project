# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Climb & Slide

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

We are planning to recreate the Chutes and Ladders game but we are going to make it more interactive for the user. in addition to the original game, the player will be faced with a variety of pop-up questions that will either boost them forward or set them back in the game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Just like the traditional game, there will be a dice that the user can roll with the sides 1-6 that will tell the user how many spaces to move. On the game board, there will be slides and ladders. The slides will set the player back while the ladders will boost them ahead. Once the user lands on certain squares, a card with a question will pop up asking the player a question. The player will then have to type their answer, and if they get it right, they will be allowed to move forward a certain number of spaces, but if they get it wrong, they will be penalized in some way. The game board will have a 10 by 10 grid labeled 1-100, and there will be symbols and images on the screen to represent the slides, ladders, characters, and dice.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not Applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I think it is viable for us to have the basic features of our game completed, such as a working dice, the animated characters, and a working slide/ladder functions.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would have randomized questions that could increase the difficulty of the game, and also have the game be multi-player.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We hope to accomplish a final game that can be multiplayer, can increase in difficulty (question difficulty) as the character approaches higher numbers on the grid, and we hope to have a completed game that is complex to keep a player entertained for multiple rounds.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We need to look further into turtle graphics to be able to animate our characters. We also have to look into how to create the background graphics of our game because we don't have any experience importing or creating different backgrounds. We also have to look more into randomization for our rolling dice and asking random card questions. We are going to split how we research the different skills we need to learn how to do, but when we are coding, we will go step by step to create the graphics for our game and then begin with programming the basic features. I think once we start the programming aspect, we will be able to better delegate who is going to develop which feature of the game.
