Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We made a visual outline of our board game with the basic checkerboard, ropes, and slides. We also typed up random trivia questions to keep the players on their toes. Also, we included character pieces to make the game more interactive. Finally, we also did research on how to create a two-player game.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We have to start the coding process for player interaction and actions such as dice rolling. We have to also figure out how to incorporate the background we created into our code. Finally, we need to include turtle graphics in our code to include the background and the game pieces.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Trying to import the image of our background and set it up on our turtle screen has been challenging. We also still need to figure out how to associate our icons and our trivia questions, and how to relate the icons to the movements that are supposed to happen with the slides and the ropes.
